# Coinbase Design System (CDS, web)

In this repo, "cds" means Coinbase's design system. It is not the Centric design
system. Section 6 is the only place Centric comes up.

## 1. At a glance

- Package: `@coinbase/cds-web` 9.29.0, with `@coinbase/cds-common` 9.29.0 and
  `@coinbase/cds-icons` 5.x (icon font). React peer range is `^18 || ~19.1.2`.
  The repo runs React 19.3.0. Nothing broke, but it's outside the declared range.
- License: Apache-2.0, per the LICENSE file in github.com/coinbase/cds (checked
  2026-10-08). The npm packages themselves carry no `license` field and no LICENSE
  file, so the repo is the only place it's stated.

## 2. How its color works

- **Two tiers.** A *spectrum* of raw hue steps (`blue0`…`blue100`, `gray0`…) and a
  *semantic color* layer (`fg`, `fgMuted`, `fgPrimary`, `bg`, `bgAlternate`,
  `bgPrimary`, `bgPrimaryWash`, `bgSecondary`, `bgTertiary`, `bgLine`, `bgNegative`,
  `bgNegativeWash`, `bgWarningWash`, `bgPositive`, the `accentSubtle*`/`accentBold*`
  set, and so on). Names are camelCase. They read as role plus emphasis: `bgX` for the
  solid, `bgXWash` for the tint, `fgX` for text in that hue.
- **Component maps.** The components don't own any color tokens. Each one maps its
  variants onto semantic names in a plain JS table in `cds-common/tokens/*`. Two
  examples: button primary is `{ color: fgInverse, background: bgPrimary }`, and banner
  warning is `{ background: bgWarningWash, iconColor: fgWarning, borderColor: bgWarning }`.
  Tags are the exception. They map straight to spectrum steps (`green0`/`green60`,
  `yellow0`/`yellow70`).
- **Where variables live.** `ThemeProvider` writes every value inline on its own
  root `<div>` (class `cds-default light|dark`). That covers `--color-*` for semantics,
  `--blue10`-style for spectrum, and `--light-*`, `--dark-*` and `--lightColor-*` for
  both schemes. Nothing goes on `:root`. The component CSS (Linaria, inside
  `@layer cds`) reads `var(--color-bgPrimary)`.
- **Light/dark.** It's a prop: `activeColorScheme="light" | "dark"`. The provider
  rewrites the inline variables and swaps the class. Spectrum inverts with the scheme
  (`gray0` is white in light and black in dark), so tags flip without separate dark
  tokens.
- **Values are raw strings.** Theme colors have to be literal `rgb()` strings, not
  `var()` or functions. The docs say so explicitly.
- **States are computed in JS.** `Interactable` (under every Button, IconButton, cell
  and select option) reads `theme.color[background]` from the **JS theme object**. It
  blends that value with d3-color at fixed opacities (hover 0.88, pressed 0.82,
  disabled 0.75; buttons use the accessible 0.5) and writes the results inline on each
  element as literal colors: `--inter-hover-bg: rgb(0,72,224)`, `--inter-press-bg`,
  `--inter-disable-bg`. Only the rest color stays a variable
  (`--inter-bg: var(--color-bgPrimary)`).
- **Disabled.** Opacity on the element, over the precomputed `--inter-disable-bg`.
  `Text` takes `disabled` and dims by opacity. There is no `fgDisabled` token.
- **Focus.** A ring in `bgLinePrimary` (brand).

## 3. Building the native page

- **Layout.** Everything is built from `Box`, `VStack` and `HStack` with theme spacing
  units (`gap={2}` = 16px on the 8px base). The two-column area and the stats row are
  `Box display="grid"` with a responsive `gridTemplateColumns`
  (`{ base, tablet, phone }`). CDS style props take responsive objects keyed to its
  breakpoints: phone < 768, tablet 768–1279, desktop ≥ 1280.
  - `Grid columnMin` is a trap. It concatenates the value into `minmax(${columnMin}, …)`,
    so `columnMin={200}` produces invalid CSS and silently gives one column. Pass
    `"200px"`.
  - `Box` defaults to `display: flex`. A flex `main` lets a wide child, like a tab row
    or a table, push the page wider than the viewport. I set `display="block"` on main.
- **Type.** `TextTitle1` (page title), `SectionHeader` (section titles and
  descriptions), `TextHeadline`, `TextBody`, `TextLabel1`/`TextLabel2`. Color comes
  only through palette props (`color="fgMuted"`, `background="bgAlternate"`).
  `SectionHeader` defaults to `paddingX={4} paddingY={2}`. Zero them when it sits
  inside a padded container.
- **Header.** `NavigationBar`, with the product name at the start and `NavLink`s in
  the middle (hidden on phones with responsive `display`). The end slot holds a
  transparent `IconButton` bell and an `Avatar`.
- **Tabs.** `Tabs` (the new API). `TabNavigation` is deprecated, slated for removal in
  v10. Tabs ship with no gap between labels, so pass `gap={3}`.
- **Form.** `TextInput` with `label` and `helperText`. The error field is
  `variant="negative"`, and its helperText becomes the error message with an icon.
  `Select` comes from `@coinbase/cds-web/alpha/select`, because the old `Select` is
  deprecated. The rest are `Switch`, `Checkbox`, and a `RadioGroup` taking an options
  record.
- **Button order.** CDS says one primary per screen. Its form and dialog examples
  right-align a **transparent secondary Cancel** beside the primary, so the form footer
  is `HStack justifyContent="flex-end"` with Cancel then Save. The hierarchy row maps
  the scene like this:
  - primary → `primary`
  - secondary → `secondary`
  - tertiary → `tertiary` (a darker gray fill, not an outline)
  - ghost → `secondary transparent`
  - danger → `negative`
  - disabled → `primary disabled`
- **Status.** Tags for table status (`colorScheme` green/blue/yellow/red at
  `emphasis="low"`). Alerts are `Banner` with `styleVariant="inline"`, which is the
  documented choice for section-level errors. `showDismiss={false}`.
- **Stats.** `ContentCard`. The old `Card` is deprecated. ContentCard defaults to a
  fixed `minWidth` and `maxWidth`, which made the cards overlap in a grid, so I reset
  them to `0` and `none`.
- **Table.** `Table variant="ruled"` with `TableHeader`/`TableBody`/`TableRow`/`TableCell`
  (`title` cells), inside a bordered `Box overflow="auto"` so it scrolls sideways on
  phones.

Missing or substituted:
- **Breadcrumb**: CDS has none. I composed it from `Link font="label2"` and a
  `TextLabel2 color="fgMuted"` slash, with `aria-current` on the last crumb.
- **Success banner**: Banner has `informational | warning | error | promotional` and
  nothing positive. Success uses `informational` with
  `startIcon="circleCheckmark" startIconColor="fgPositive"`, both documented props.
  `promotional` is brand-tinted, so I didn't use it for status.
- **Outline button**: none. Tertiary is a filled gray.
- **Breakpoint-driven nav**: CDS's desktop app pattern is a `Sidebar`. I used the top
  `NavigationBar` because it works at both widths without a drawer.

## 4. What the solved theme reached

The profile sets 14 semantic variables: `bg`, `bgAlternate`, `bgPrimary`,
`bgSecondary`, `bgTertiary`, `bgLine`, `bgLineHeavy`, `bgNegative`, `bgNegativeWash`,
`fg`, `fgMuted`, `fgInverse`, `fgPrimary`, `fgNegative`. With the provider div listed
as a scope, every component that reads one of those at rest picked up the solved value.

Reached:
- **Primary**: buttons, the switch track, the checked checkbox, the radio dot, the
  active tab label and indicator, links and the breadcrumb link.
- **Neutral steps**: the stat cards (`bgAlternate`), secondary and tertiary buttons,
  page background, borders and text.
- **Banners**: the informational banner's icon and border turned brand magenta. CDS's
  own map points informational at `fgPrimary`/`bgPrimary`, so in this system info
  *is* brand.
- **Danger**: the danger button and the negative input.

Didn't reach:
- **Hover, pressed and disabled on every interactive element.** These are literal
  colors computed in JS from the stock theme object. Measured on the themed page, the
  magenta primary button still hovers to `rgb(0,72,224)` (stock blue), and the
  disabled "Publish" button renders `rgb(20,96,255)` at 50% opacity. A CSS-variable
  override can't reach them. The fix is to pass the solved colors into the
  `ThemeProvider` theme object (`lightColor`/`darkColor`) so the blends are computed
  from them.
- **Tags.** These read spectrum variables (`--green0`, `--yellow70`), which aren't in
  the profile. "In production" stays blue.
- **Warning banner.** `bgWarningWash`, `fgWarning` and `bgWarning` aren't in the
  profile.
- **Positive.** `fgPositive` (the success icon) isn't in the profile.
- **Avatar fallback.** Spectrum blue, by `colorScheme`.
- **Things outside the scope div.** Inline values sit on the provider div, so any
  portal without its own `isolated` ThemeProvider would miss them, including the
  alpha Select dropdown. Not shown in the shots because the dropdown is closed.

## 5. Accessibility notes (stock)

- Disabled primary: white text over 50%-opacity blue is roughly 2.2:1. That's
  intentional for disabled and exempt from WCAG, but the label is hard to read.
- Disabled text is `fgMuted` at reduced opacity, about 2.2:1 on white. Fine for
  disabled, but there's no separate token to tune it.
- `fgMuted` on `bg` is about 6.3:1. On `bgAlternate` (the stat cards) it is lower, about
  5.5:1, which still passes AA.
- The transparent ghost button has no visible boundary at rest, only text. Pairing it
  with a primary is fine. On its own it reads as plain text.
- Low-emphasis tags (`green60` on `green0`) pass easily in light mode. In dark mode the
  spectrum inversion keeps them readable.

## 6. Ideas for the Centric design system

Borrow:
- **Component variant maps as data.** `tokens/button.js` maps each variant to semantic
  names in a plain object, shared by web and React Native. Centric ships Vue, React,
  React Native and Angular. One framework-free map per component (variant →
  semantic tokens) would be the component tier of the 3-tier model in a portable form,
  and every framework binding could read it.
- **Wash/solid/fg triplets per intent** (`bgNegative`, `bgNegativeWash`, `fgNegative`).
  That's the exact set a status banner, a tag and an inline error need. It maps cleanly
  onto Radix steps 3/9/11 for Centric's status scales.
- **Responsive style props keyed to named breakpoints** (`{ base, phone, tablet }`).
  Dense PLM layouts change shape at breakpoints. Expressing that in props instead of
  per-component media queries keeps layouts declarative across frameworks.
- **A first-class dense theme.** CDS ships `coinbaseDenseTheme` next to the default:
  the same tokens with smaller space and control sizes. That's density as a theme swap,
  not a per-component prop, which suits Centric's density modes.

Avoid:
- **JS-computed interaction states.** Blending hover and pressed from the JS theme
  object and writing literal colors inline means any CSS-variable theming (a customer
  brand, a vertical theme) breaks every hover state. Centric should compute state
  colors in CSS (separate step tokens from the Radix scale, or `color-mix()` over the
  variable) so one variable change carries through.
- **Theme variables only on a provider div.** It works, but portals need their own
  isolated provider, and tooling can't find the values on `:root`. Centric's tables,
  menus and bulk-edit popovers are portal-heavy. Root-level variables with a
  class-scoped override are simpler.
- **No success banner, and info = brand.** In a PLM app, "approved" and "shipped" are
  the most common statuses. Status intents should be complete (success, info, warning,
  danger, neutral) and never alias brand.
- **Tags on raw spectrum steps.** Theming and status meaning get lost. Route tags
  through semantic status tokens.

## 7. Open issues

- **Contract issue in `kit.tsx`.** `restore()` writes back the inline values it saved
  before applying. CDS's provider rewrites those same inline variables on a mode
  switch, so going from themed light to stock dark restored *light* values over the
  provider's fresh dark ones. The result was a half-light dark page. I worked around it
  in the page by keying `ThemeProvider` on mode, so each switch gets a new div. That
  resets form state on a mode switch. The real fix belongs in the kit: on restore, skip
  any property whose current inline value isn't the one the kit set. (Fixed in the
  kit on 2026-10-08; the mode-keyed provider workaround was removed.)
- **The profile misses intents.** It covers no warning, positive or spectrum
  variables, so tags, the warning banner and success icons never theme. Its dark
  selector is listed as `.dark`, but the provider uses inline values on
  `.cds-default.dark`.
- **The solved theme should also feed the JS theme object**, so hover, pressed and
  disabled follow. That would need a contract hook, for example
  `render(mode, values)`.
- **The alpha Select dropdown was not checked open.** It portals.
